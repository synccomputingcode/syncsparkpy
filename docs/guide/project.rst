Projects
========

Projects are Sync-enabled Apache Spark applications. They provide a means of continuous optimization and tracking.

On-boarding
-----------

To on-board a Spark application it must be executed with a configuration that includes Sync metadata and an event log destination.

Iterative Optimization
----------------------

Once an application is on-boarded its configuration can be improved for better performance and/or lower cost with each run.
To provide this the SDK provides 2 functions.
