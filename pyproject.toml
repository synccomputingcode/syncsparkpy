# NOTE - versions of Hatchling more recent than 1.8.0 have a dependency on pathspec >= 0.10.1. However,
#  Databricks Runtime versions only have pathspec==0.9.0 installed, and so attempting to `pip install ...`
#  syncsparkpy will fail with an `AttributeError`. Pinning Hatching to this version, which is the most
#  recent version to only require pathspec >= 0.9.0, resolves that issue without asking the user to
#  install pathspec >= 0.10.1 on their Databricks clusters. We should only ever upgrade this version once
#  most/all Databricks Runtime LTS releases support pathspec >= 0.10.1, which may be a while...
# See here for DBR release notes - https://docs.databricks.com/release-notes/runtime/releases.html
